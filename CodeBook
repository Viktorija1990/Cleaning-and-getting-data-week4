Description of the dataset:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The data
The dataset includes the following files:
'README.txt'
'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.
'features.txt': List of all features.
'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING).
'train/X_train.txt': Training set.
'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.
'test/X_test.txt': Test set.
'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.
'train/subject_train.txt': the subjects who performed the activity for each window sample. Train set.
'train/subject_test.txt': the subjects who performed the activity for each window sample. Test set.

Data transformation and manipulation
The analysis includes the following steps:
1.	Reading data from each single .txt file using the read.table command
2.	Merge train and test data using the rbind function.
3.	Assign feature names to their correspondent values (colnames), and finally add the feature column to the merged data set.
4.	Merging data from step 3 with activity type and subject using cbind function.
5.	Subset only measurement of the mean and standard deviation using grep function.
6.	Create a new idependent data set (called summary) with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject, using the lapply function.
7.	Sorting results using order functiion.
8.	Write the resulting data set into a .txt file names "tidydata.txt".
